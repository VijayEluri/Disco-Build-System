Show the list of packages currently defined in the build system. For
example:

    bml show-pkg
    
will list the names of all packages previously defined. There will always
be a package named "<import>" that all files and actions belong to if they
haven't otherwise been assigned to a package.

To add new packages, use the add-pkg command. To remove packages that
are no longer needed, use the rm-pkg command. To place files and/or actions
into a package, use the set-file-pkg and set-action-pkg commands.
