Show the list of packages currently defined in the build system. For
example:

    bml show-pkg
    
will list the names of all packages previously defined. There will always
be a package named "None" that all files and tasks belong to if they haven't
otherwise been assigned to a package.

To add new packages, use the add-pkg command. To remove packages that
are no longer needed, use the rm-pkg command. To place files and/or tasks
into a package, use the set-file-pkg and set-task-pkg commands.
