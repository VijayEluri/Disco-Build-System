Rename an existing package or folder. The name must be unique across all
existing packages and folders. Changing a package or folder name does not
change its parent folder.

For example:

    bmladmin rename-pkg packageA compressLib

will rename the package named "packageA" with a more suitable name,
"compressLib". Also,

	bmladmin rename-pkg Folder2 LibFolder
	
will rename the folder named "Folder2" to "LibFolder". The content of the
folder is unchanged.    

The command arguments are:

<old-name>
    
  The name of the existing package or folder.
  
<new-name>

  The new name to give to the package or folder. This name must be unique
  across all existing packages and folders.
