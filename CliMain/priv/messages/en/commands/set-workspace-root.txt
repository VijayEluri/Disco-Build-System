Set the path for the workspace root (@workspace) on the BuildML Virtual File
System (VFS). This is the root path for all source code, so the product's
entire source code (grouped into packages) must fall within the bounds of
@workspace. The typical exception to this rule is native header files and
libraries (/usr/include and /usr/lib).

For example, to set the workspace root:

    bmladmin set-workspace-root /products/ping_pong
    
This VFS directory can now be accessed via the @workspace root, with all
source files being accessed relative to this root (or relative to one of
the package roots contained within the VFS).

By default, when packages are created, their 'src' and 'gen' package roots
default to the same location as @workspace. It's important to note that
all package roots must remain at the same level, or below @workspace. It
is therefore illegal to set @workspace below any existing package root.

The command arguments are:

<path>

  The directory path (within the BuildML VFS) at which the root should be
  placed. The <path> value would typically be an absolute path.
