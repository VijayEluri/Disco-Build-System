Scan through the specified directories on the local file system, and add all
files and directories to the BuildML database. This is used for importing
an existing source or object tree, purely by looking at which files exist
on the disk, rather than only learning about the files if an action were to
access them.

One or more directories may be provided to this command, with each of them
being traversed and their information added to the BuildML database. For
example:

    bmladmin scan-tree /home/psmith/myappsrc /usr/include /usr/lib
    
will locate all files and directories in the "myappsrc" directory, as a means
of importing the complete set of files in the source tree. Also, we import
the standard include and library directories, to make sure we have a complete
record of which files could potentially be used in the build process.
    
The command arguments are:

<path>

  A path on the local file system (as distinct from a path within the BuildML
  database). When the directory and its contents are added to the database,
  the full absolute path of the directory will be used (even if you specify
  a relative pathname on the command line).
