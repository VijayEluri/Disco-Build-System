Show all the tasks that access a specific set of files. This is used to learn
which tasks either generate (write to), or make use of (read from) a specific
set of files. 

For example, to learn which tasks access the trees.o file in some way, use:

    bml show-tasks-that-use trees.o
    
To learn which tasks read from (but not write to) trees.o, use:

    bml show-tasks-that-use --read trees.o
    
Conversely, to discover which task generates trees.o, use:

    bml show-tasks-that-use --write trees.o

The argument to show-tasks-that-use must be a file specification:

<file-specification>

  Input files are provided in a colon-separated list, using the following
  syntax:

#include options/path-spec.txt


By default, show-tasks-that-use will display all relevant tasks, although
this can be controlled by various command-specific options.
		
Command-specific options are:

-r | --read

  Only show tasks that read from any of the specified files. By default, a
  task is reported if it either reads, writes, modifies or deletes the file.
  
-w | --write

  Only show tasks that write to any of the specified files. By default, a
  task is reported if it either reads, writes, modifies or deletes the file.

-m | --modify

  Only show tasks that modify any of the specified files. By default, a
  task is reported if it either reads, writes, modifies or deletes the file.

-d | --delete

  Only show tasks that delete any of the specified files. By default, a
  task is reported if it either reads, writes, modifies or deletes the file.
