Add a new package to the BuildML build system. The package will initially 
not contain any files or tasks. For example:

    bml add-pkg src_code
    
will create a new empty package named "src_code". It will now be possible
to add files and tasks into the "src_code" package using the set-file-pkg
and set-task-pkg commands.

The command arguments are:

#include options/pkg-name.txt
