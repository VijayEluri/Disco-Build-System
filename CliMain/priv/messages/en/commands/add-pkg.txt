Add a new package or package folder to the BuildML build system. The package
or folder will be placed directly beneath the "Root" folder, and will 
initially not contain any files, actions, or sub-folders. For example:

    bml add-pkg src_code
    
will create a new empty package named "src_code". It will now be possible
to add files and actions into the "src_code" package using the set-file-pkg
and set-action-pkg commands.

To add a package folder, use the -f (--folder) flag:

    bml add-pkg -f src_folder

Packages (and other folders) may be moved into this new folder by using the
move-pkg command.

The command arguments are:

#include options/pkg-name.txt

<folder-name>
    
  An identifier representing the package folder name. The same syntax rules
  apply as for <pkg-name>.
