Remove an action from the build system, moving any child actions up one level
in the action tree. This is used when an action doesn't provide a meaningful
contribution to the build system. 

This command is often used when the action represents an invoke of a legacy
build tool, such as "make". In this case, we don't want to import the "make"
process itself, but we do care about make's children.

The command arguments are:
  
<action>

      bmladmin rm-action 8
