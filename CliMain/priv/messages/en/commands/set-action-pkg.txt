Add an action, or set of actions, to one of the BuildML build system packages.
Adding actions to a package provides a convenient way to group those actions,
allowing the actions to be referred to by a single name.

For example, to add a number of different actions to a package, use:

    bmladmin set-action-pkg src_code 100:23:2/:44/
    bmladmin set-action-pkg src_code 11:22
    
It is now possible to reference this complete set of actions by using the
%pkg syntax. For example:

    bmladmin show-actions -f %pkg/src_code
    
will show all the actions that have been added to the "src_code" package, 
whereas:

    bmladmin show-actions -f %not-pkg/src_code
    
will show all the actions that are NOT inside that package.

Note: an individual action will always reside in exactly one package, even if
it's the default "<import>" package. To remove an action from a package, use
set-action-pkg to add the action to the default "<import>" package, or to some
other user-defined package.

The command arguments are:

#include options/pkg-name.txt

<action-spec>:...

  A colon-separated list specifying which actions should be added to the 
  package. This includes any of the following formats:

#include options/action-spec.txt
