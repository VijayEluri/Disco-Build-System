Modify a build action so that it no longer has child actions, yet has the same
effect as the original action hierarchy. For many tools, a process may create
additional sub-processes to complete the job. If we are not interested in
knowing about these sub-processes, the parent action can be made "atomic".

For example, the original action hierarchy may be:

  gcc -c -o foo.o foo.c
    cc1 -o /tmp/zyzyz.s foo.c
    as -o foo.o /tmp/zyzyz.s
    
By making the parent action (gcc) atomic, the two child processes are removed.
You will therefore be left with a single parent action:

  gcc -c -o foo.o foo.c

All file accesses performed by the parent action, or any of its child actions,
will now be associated with the parent action. Temporary files (such as 
/tmp/zyzyzs.s) will be automatically removed.
    
The command arguments are:
  
<action ID>

  The number ID number of the parent action.
        
      bml make-atomic 12
      bml make-atomic 167
