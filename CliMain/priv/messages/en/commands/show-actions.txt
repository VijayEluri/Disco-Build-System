Show all the actions in the build system. This provides a complete list of
actions and their parent/child hierarchy. That is, one action may invoke a
number of sub-actions, which in turn may invoke further actions.

By default all actions are shown, although this can be controlled by various
command-specific options.
		
Command-specific options are:

#include options/action-short.txt

#include options/action-long.txt

#include options/action-show-pkgs.txt

#include options/action-filter.txt
