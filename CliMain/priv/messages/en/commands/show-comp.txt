Show the list of components currently defined in the build system. For
example:

    bml show-comp
    
will list the names of all components previously defined. There will always
be a component named "None" that all files and tasks belong to if they haven't
otherwise been assigned to a component.

To add new components, use the add-comp command. To remove components that
are no longer needed, use the rm-comp command. To place files and/or tasks
into a component, use the set-file-comp and set-task-comp commands.
