Show the files that are used by a specific build task, or set of tasks. 
By default, all relevant files are shown, although this can be controlled
by various command-specific options.

A colon-separated list of tasks must be provided, using the following syntax:

#include options/task-spec.txt
		
The show-files-used-by command has further options for controlling the output:

  that are accessed (read, written, modified, or deleted) will be shown.

-w | --write

  Only show files that the specified tasks write to. By default, all files
  that are accessed (read, written, modified, or deleted) will be shown. 
  
-m | --modify

  Only show files that are modified by the specified tasks. By default, all
  files that are accessed (read, written, modified, or deleted) will be shown.

-d | --delete

  Only show files that are deleted by the specified tasks. By default, all 
  files that are accessed (read, written, modified, or deleted) will be shown.
