Show all the files used in the build system. This provides a complete list of
files, regardless of how each file is used (source or generated file), or
which build tasks reference the file. By default, all files are shown,
although the set of files can be controlled by various command-specific
options.
		
Command-specific options are:

#include options/file-show-pkgs.txt

#include options/show-roots.txt

#include options/file-filter.txt
