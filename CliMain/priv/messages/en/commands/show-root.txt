Show the list of file roots currently defined in the build system. If a root
name is provided as an argument, only that root's definition will be shown.
For example:

    bmladmin show-root
    
shows all roots defined in the build system, whereas
    
    bmladmin show-root src_root
    
shows only the definition of "src_root".
    
The command arguments are:

<name>

  An arbitrary text name for the root. Must not contain the @ or :
  characters.
