Create a new empty build.bml database file in the current directory, in 
preparation for performing other administrative commands. If the database
file already exists, this command has no effect.

To create build.bml in the current directory, use:

    bmladmin create
    
To create a database file with a non-standard name, use the global -f option:

    bmladmin -f test.bml create
