Add a new file root tag to the current build system. This allows the user to
refer to a particular sub-tree of files by using a meaningful name. For
example, the top of the source file tree could be labeled with "src_root",
whereas the top of the object file tree could be "obj_root".

Once a root is defined, the root name may be used in any place where an
absolute path name is expected. For example:

    bml add-root src_root /home/psmith/mysrc
    
The root can then be access by using the @ prefix. For example:

    bml show-files -f @src_root/libraries
    
To show the list of currently defined roots, use the show-root command, 
whereas to remove a root definition, use the rm-root command. Note that
to change the definition of a root, simply reissue the add-root command
with the new path. For example:

    bml add-root src_root /home/psmith/my_new_src
    
This will replace the old definition with the new path.
    
The command arguments are:

<name>

  An arbitrary text name for the root. Must not contain the @ or :
  characters.
  
<path>

  The file location to attach the root. The can either be an absolute
  path name, or a path that references a root. For example, the following
  two statements have the same effect.
        
      bml add-root libraries_root /home/psmith/mysrc/libraries
      bml add-root libraries_root @src_root/libraries
