Delete a file root tag from the current build system. For example:

    bml rm-root src_root

The root can no longer be used in path expressions.

Note that it is not possible to remove the default root, named "root".
    
The command arguments are:

<name>

  An arbitrary text name for the root. Must not contain the @ or :
  characters.
