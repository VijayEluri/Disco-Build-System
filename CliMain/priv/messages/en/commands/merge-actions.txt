Merge two or more shell command actions into a single action. The shell
commands from each of the actions will be merged into a single shell command.

The only requirement for the selected actions is that they all be atomic (no
child actions).

The command arguments are:

<action-set>

This set of actions must conform to the following specifications:

#include options/action-spec.txt
