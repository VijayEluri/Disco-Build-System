Move an existing package or folder into a new parent folder.

For example:

    bmladmin move-pkg packageA Folder2

will move the package named "packageA" into the folder named "Folder2". Also,

	bmladmin move-pkg Folder2 OldFolder
	
will move the folder named "Folder2" and all of its content (packages and
other folders) into the folder named "OldFolder".    

The command arguments are:

#include options/pkg-name.txt

<folder-name>
    
  The folder to be moved. The same syntax rules apply as for <pkg-name>.
  
<dest-folder-name>

  The destination folder into which the package (or source folder) will be
  moved.
