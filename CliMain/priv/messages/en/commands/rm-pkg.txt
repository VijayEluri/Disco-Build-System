Remove an existing package from the BuildML build system. A package must
no longer contain any files or actions, otherwise the removal will fail.
Likewise, a folder must not contain any packages or sub-folders.

For example:

    bml rm-pkg src_code
    
will remove the "src_code" package, assuming it is no longer in use. It is
not possible to remove the "<import>" package or the "Root" folder, even if
they're empty.

The command arguments are:

#include options/pkg-name.txt

<folder-name>
    
  An identifier representing the package folder name. The same syntax rules
  apply as for <pkg-name>.
