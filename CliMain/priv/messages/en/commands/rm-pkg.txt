Remove an existing package from the BuildML build system. The package must
no longer contain any files or actions, otherwise the removal will fail.
For example:

    bml rm-pkg src_code
    
will remove the "src_code" package, assuming it is no longer in use. It is
not possible to remove the "<import>" package, even if it's empty.

The command arguments are:

#include options/pkg-name.txt
