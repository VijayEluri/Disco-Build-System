Specify the number of directory levels that exist between this build.bml file
and the @workspace root. This is an administrative command only.

To simplify the mapping of BuildML Virtual File System (VFS) files onto a
native file system, the build.bml file depth value is used as the default.
That is, when a BuildML build is invoked, the native file system mapping
for @workspace must be determined, since all BuildML actions will access their
files relative to @workspace (or to some package's root).

By using the depth value, the native file system workspace root can be
automatically derived from the location of the build.bml file. For example,
if this build.bml file is located at:

  /home/psmith/work/src/build/build.bml (on the native file system)
  
a depth value of 2 will associate the VFS @workspace root with the native file
system path:

  /home/psmith/work/ (on the native file system)

The command arguments are:

<depth>

  The number of directory level between this build.bml file and the @workspace
  root.
