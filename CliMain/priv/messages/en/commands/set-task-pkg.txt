Add a task, or set of tasks, to one of the BuildML build system packages.
Adding tasks to a package provides a convenient way to group those tasks,
allowing the tasks to be referred to by a single name.

For example, to add a number of different tasks to a package, use:

    bml set-task-pkg src_code 100:23:2/:44/
    bml set-task-pkg src_code 11:22
    
It is now possible to reference this complete set of tasks by using the
%pkg syntax. For example:

    bml show-tasks -f %pkg/src_code
    
will show all the tasks that have been added to the "src_code" package, 
whereas:

    bml show-tasks -f %not-pkg/src_code
    
will show all the tasks that are NOT inside that package.

Note: an individual task will always reside in exactly one package, even if
it's the default "None" package. To remove a task from a package, use
set-task-pkg to add the task to the default "None" package, or to some
other user-defined package.

The command arguments are:

#include options/pkg-name.txt

<task-spec>:...

  A colon-separated list specifying which tasks should be added to the 
  package. This includes any of the following formats:

#include options/task-spec.txt
