Set the 'source' or 'generated' path root for the specified package. Each
BuildML package has two associated path roots, indicating the top-most
directory for files that reside in that package. 

For example, the package "zlib" has two associated path roots:

  - zlib_src - The top-most directory for zlib's source files.
  - zlib_gen - The top-most directory for zlib's generated files.

All files within a package are accessed relative to these path roots,
essentially creating a separate directory structure for each package.
Packages can therefore be moved to an arbitrary location on the underlying
native file system, without regard for where other packages might be located.

To create a new package and set the package's root, use the following:

    bml add-pkg zlib
    bml set-pkg-root zlib_src /home/joe/work/zlib
    bml set-pkg-root zlib_gen /home/joe/obj/zlib
    
Note that these paths are internal to the BuildML file system, rather than
on the native file system.

The command arguments are:

<pkg-root-name>

  An identifier representing a package root name. This is composed of the
  package name followed by "_src" for the package's source root, or "_gen"
  for the generated file root.

<path>

  The directory path (within the BuildML file system) at which the root
  should be placed. The <path> can either be an absolute path (starting
  with /), or be relative to an existing root (such as @workspace/).
