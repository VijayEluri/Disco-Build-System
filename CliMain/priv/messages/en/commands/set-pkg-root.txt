Set the 'source' or 'generated' path root for the specified package. Each
BuildML package has two associated path roots, indicating the top-most
directory for files that reside in that package. 

For example, the package "zlib" has two associated path roots:

  - zlib_src - The top-most directory for zlib's source files.
  - zlib_gen - The top-most directory for zlib's generated files.

All files within a package are accessed relative to these path roots,
essentially creating a separate directory structure for each package.
Packages can therefore be moved to an arbitrary location on the underlying
native file system, without regard for where other packages might be located.

To create a new package and set the package's root, use the following:

    bmladmin add-pkg zlib
    bmladmin set-pkg-root zlib_src /home/joe/work/zlib
    bmladmin set-pkg-root zlib_gen /home/joe/obj/zlib
    
Note that these paths are on the BuildML virtual file system (VFS), rather
than on the native file system.

Two important restrictions apply to the location of a package root on the VFS:

  1) The new root must be at the same directory level, or lower, than the
     @workspace root. By default, all package roots are set to the same
     location as @workspace.
     
  2) All pre-existing files that belong to the package must remain inside
     that package's root directory. That is, you may not move the root to
     a lower directory so that some of the files in the package can no longer
     be accessed relative to (within) the package root.
     
     Note the important distinction here between files that are members of
     the package, versus files that appear in the VFS below the package root.
     It is certainly possible for files from other packages (including
     <import>) to appear below the package's root.

The command arguments are:

<pkg-root-name>

  An identifier representing a package root name. This is composed of the
  package name followed by "_src" for the package's source root, or "_gen"
  for the generated file root.

<path>

  The directory path (within the BuildML file system) at which the root
  should be placed. The <path> can either be an absolute path (starting
  with /), or be relative to an existing root (such as @workspace/).
