Remove an existing component from the BuildML build system. The component must
no longer contain any files or tasks, otherwise the removal will fail.
For example:

    bml rm-comp src_code
    
will remove the "src_code" component, assuming it is no longer in use. It is
not possible to remove the "None" component, even if it's empty.

The command arguments are:

#include options/comp-name.txt
