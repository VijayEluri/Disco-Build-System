    <task-number>
 
      The unique ID number of the task to be included. To specify multiple
      tasks, separate the task number with colons (for example, 1:2:3).
 
    <task-number>/
    
      The unique ID number of a parent task that will be included. Also
      include all sub-tasks that are invoked by that parent task.
    
    <task-number>/<depth>
    
      Similar to <task-number>/, but only include tasks up to <depth> levels
      beneath the specified task. A depth of 1 includes only the task itself,
      whereas a depth of 2 includes the task and its immediate children.
    
    -<task-number>
    
      Exclude the specified task from the resulting set. This is most useful
      when combined with a previous task inclusion. For example, to include
      all tasks below task 2, with the exception of tasks 45 and 93, use the
      following syntax: 2/:-45:-93.
    
    -<task-number>/
    
      Exclude the specified tasks, and all of its children.
      
    -<task-number>/<depth>
  
      Exclude the specified tasks, and <depth> levels of its child tasks.
         
    %p/<pkg-name> or %pkg/<pkg-name>
      
      Include all the tasks that have previously been added to the <pkg-name>
      package (using the set-task-pkg command).
      
    %np/<pkg-name> or %not-pkg/<pkg-name>
    
      Include all the tasks that have NOT been added to the <pkg-name>
      package.
