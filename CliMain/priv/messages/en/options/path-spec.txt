    <full-path-name>
       
      A full path name, relative to the root of the file system. For example:
           
          bmladmin show-files -f /home/psmith/mycode/src/file.c
                
      If the path is a directory, all files (and subdirectories) within that
      path will be included.
           
    <file-name-pattern>
       
      A standard file name, possibly using one or more * wildcard characters.
      This includes all files that match the name (or pattern), without
      concern for which directory the file is within. For example:
           
          bmladmin show-files -f "*.h"
                
      This filter is useful for including a file by a shorter name, rather
      than providing the full directory path.
           
    @<root-name>/<path>
       
      A root name, and a path relative to that root. For example:
           
          bmladmin show-files -f @src/lib/graphics
                
      Use the show-root, add-root and rm-root commands to manage file system
      roots.
           
    %p/<pkg-name> or %pkg/<pkg-name>
       
      A package name, specifying the set of files to be shown. Only files
      that reside within that package will be shown. For example:
           
          bmladmin show-files -f %pkg/kernel_src
                
      Use the show-pkg, add-pkg, rm-pkg commands to define package names,
      and the set-file-pkg command to add files into a package. Package 
      names may also include a package scope name, such as 'public' or
      'private'. For example:
           
          bmladmin show-files -f %pkg/kernel_src/private
                
      This will limit the output to only those files within the specific
      package scope.
           
    %np/<pkg-name> or %not-pkg/<pkg-name>
       
      Similar to %p and %pkg, but only show the files that reside outside
      that package. For example:
           
          bmladmin show-files -f %pkg/kernel_src
                
      Package scope names (private, public) can also be used.
