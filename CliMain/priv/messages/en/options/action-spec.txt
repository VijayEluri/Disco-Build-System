    <action-number>
 
      The unique ID number of the action to be included. To specify multiple
      actions, separate the action number with colons (for example, 1:2:3).
 
    <action-number>/
    
      The unique ID number of a parent action that will be included. Also
      include all sub-actions that are invoked by that parent action.
    
    <action-number>/<depth>
    
      Similar to <action-number>/, but only include actions up to <depth> 
      levels beneath the specified action. A depth of 1 includes only the
      action itself, whereas a depth of 2 includes the action and its immediate
      children.
    
    -<action-number>
    
      Exclude the specified action from the resulting set. This is most useful
      when combined with a previous action inclusion. For example, to include
      all actions below action 2, with the exception of actions 45 and 93, 
      use the following syntax: 2/:-45:-93.
    
    -<action-number>/
    
      Exclude the specified actions, and all of its children.
      
    -<action-number>/<depth>
  
      Exclude the specified actions, and <depth> levels of its child actions.
         
    %p/<pkg-name> or %pkg/<pkg-name>
      
      Include all the actions that have previously been added to the <pkg-name>
      package (using the set-action-pkg command).
      
    %np/<pkg-name> or %not-pkg/<pkg-name>
    
      Include all the actions that have NOT been added to the <pkg-name>
      package.
