How to Compile BuildML
----------------------

To compile the BuildML release from source code, execute the following commands
in this directory:

  % ant all
  
This will generate a release "tar-ball" in Admin/pub/ directory. The release
image is named buildml-W.X.Y.tar.gz, where W.X.Y is the version number of the
current code base.

To build with a different version number, use:

  % ant all -Dversion=W.Y.Z

To run all tests (unit tests and cli tests), execute the following:

  % ant test

These tests could easily take at least 5 minutes. The test scripts will halt
immediately upon finding a problem.

For more choices on what to build, see the help information:

  % ant help


Building BuildML in a Development Envionment
--------------------------------------------

Given that the above procedure for compiling BuildML is rather time-consuming
for BuildML developers, there's a faster way to get a runnable program. This 
feature allows you to edit source code using Eclipse, then immediately run
the "bml" command to test your changes.

There are two steps required to make this work:

1) Set your shell $PATH variable to include:

   .../CliMain/priv/scripts/
   
   you'll be able to run the "bml" shell script that's resident in that
   directory (as opposed to extracting the buildml-W.Y.Z.tar.gz in order to run 
   it). When used in this mode, the "bml" script picks up .class files and
   .jar files directly from your source tree. 

2) Make sure you've built version 0.0.0 of the full BuildML package. This is
   required since the dynamically loadable .so files, and the "cfs" executable
   program must be in a well-known place. The bml script will look in this
   directory when loading those programs. Unfortunately, this implies that
   native C/C++ code must be compiled with the full "ant all" build step.
   
It's very important that you build with version 0.0.0 ("ant all 
-Dversion=0.0.0"), and that all BuildML databases you use have the embedded
schema version of 0. When executing .class files directly from the source
tree, they'll automatically use schema version 0, and the code and the
database content must use the exact same schema version numbers.
