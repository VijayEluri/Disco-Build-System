Add a task, or set of tasks, to one of the Disco build system components.
Adding tasks to a component provides a convenient way to group those tasks,
allowing the tasks to be referred to by a single name.

For example, to add a number of different tasks to a component, use:

    disco set-task-comp src_code 100:23:2/:44/
    disco set-task-comp src_code 11:22
    
It is now possible to reference this complete set of tasks by using the
%comp syntax. For example:

    disco show-tasks -f %comp/src_code
    
will show all the tasks that have been added to the "src_code" component, 
whereas:

    disco show-tasks -f %not-comp/src_code
    
will show all the tasks that are NOT inside that component.

Note: an individual task will always reside in exactly one component, even if
it's the default "None" component. To remove a task from a component, use
set-task-comp to add the task to the default "None" component, or to some
other user-defined component.

The command arguments are:

#include options/comp-name.txt

<task-spec>:...

  A colon-separated list specifying which tasks should be added to the 
  component. This includes any of the following formats:

#include options/task-spec.txt
