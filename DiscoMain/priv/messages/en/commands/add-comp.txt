Add a new component to the Disco build system. The component will initially 
not contain any files or tasks. For example:

    disco add-comp src_code
    
will create a new empty component named "src_code". It will now be possible
to add files and tasks into the "src_code" component using the set-file-comp
and set-task-comp commands.

The command arguments are:

#include options/comp-name.txt
