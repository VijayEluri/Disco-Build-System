Show the files in the build system that written-to, but are never read-from. 
These files typically represent the final output of the build process, 
although in some cases they're intermediate files that are generated but
never used. In that case, they are ideal candidates for being removed from
the build system.

Command-specific options are:

#include options/show-comps.txt

#include options/show-roots.txt

#include options/file-filter.txt
