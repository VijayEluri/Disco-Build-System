Show the files in the build system that are not referenced by any build tasks.
These are typically files that reside in the source tree, but are never
accessed during the build process. In some cases, these files are considered
"useless" and can be deleted. The output of this report can be controlled 
by command-specific options.

Command-specific options are:

#include options/file-show-comps.txt

#include options/show-roots.txt

#include options/file-filter.txt
