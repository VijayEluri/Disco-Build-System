Scan through an Electric Accelerator annotation file (typically with the
name "emake.xml"), and import the build task and file access information
into the Disco database. For example:

    disco scan-ea-anno emake.xml
    
will import the content of the emake.xml annotation file and construct a
Disco database with the equivalent content. This does not create a fully
functional Disco build system, but the database can be used for querying
the legacy build system.
    
The command arguments are:

<emake-annotation-file>

  An annotation file, as produced by Electric Accelerator. To generate this
  file, be sure to use the following emake options:
 
    --emake-annodetail=basic,file,history,waiting
    
  Note that this command has only had limited testing with a single version
  of annotation files.
