Add a file, or set of files, to one of the Disco build system components.
Adding files to a component provides a convenient way to group those files,
allowing the set to be referred to by a single name.

For example, to add a number of different files to a component, use:

    disco set-file-comp src_code *.c:*.h
    disco set-file-comp src_code /usr/include:/usr/local/include
    disco set-file-comp src_code /home/psmith/mysrc
    
This option adds all known files with the .c or .h suffix to the component,
then continues by adding the complete content of /usr/include,
/usr/local/include and /home/psmith/mysrc.

It is now possible to reference this complete set of files by using the
%comp syntax. For example:

    disco show-files -f %comp/src_code
    
will show all the files that have been added to the "src_code" component, 
whereas:

    disco show-files -f %not-comp/src_code
    
will show all the files that are NOT inside that component.

Additionally, files can be added inside a sub-section of a component. For
example:

   disco set-file-comp src_code/public /usr/include
   
will indicate that the files in /usr/include are within the src_code
component's "public" section. Whereas:

   disco set-file-comp src_code/private /home/psmith/mysrc
   
places the files in the "private" section. Section names are predefined and
can not be modified by the user.

Note: an individual file will always reside in exactly one component, even if
it's the default "None" component. To remove a file from a component, use
set-file-comp to add the file to the default "None" component, or to some
other user-defined component.

The command arguments are:

#include options/comp-name.txt

<path-spec>:...

  A colon-separated list of paths to specify which files should be added to
  the component. This includes any of the following formats:

#include options/path-spec.txt
