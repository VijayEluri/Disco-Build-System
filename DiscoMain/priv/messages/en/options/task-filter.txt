-f | --filter <filter1>:...

  Only show the tasks specified by the filter string, which is a
  colon-separated list of one or more filter specifications. Each filter
  specification describes the type of task you're interested in seeing. 
  Filter specifications are additive, so providing two filters results 
  in the union of the two being shown.
   
  Filter specifications can be used to state which tasks should be 
  included in the output.
