    <full-path-name>
       
      A full path name, relative to the root of the file system. For example:
           
          disco show-files -f /home/psmith/mycode/src/file.c
                
      If the path is a directory, all files (and subdirectories) within that
      path will be included.
           
    <file-name-pattern>
       
      A standard file name, possibly using one or more * wildcard characters.
      This includes all files that match the name (or pattern), without
      concern for which directory the file is within. For example:
           
          disco show-files -f "*.h"
                
      This filter is useful for including a file by a shorter name, rather
      than providing the full directory path.
           
    @<root-name>/<path>
       
      A root name, and a path relative to that root. For example:
           
          disco show-files -f @src/lib/graphics
                
      Use the show-root, add-root and rm-root commands to manage file system
      roots.
           
    %c/<comp-name> or %comp/<comp-name>
       
      A component name, specifying the set of files to be shown. Only files
      that reside within that component will be shown. For example:
           
          disco show-files -f %comp/kernel_src
                
      Use the show-comp, add-comp, rm-comp commands to define component names,
      and the set-file-comp command to add files into a component. Component 
      names may also include a component section name, such as 'public' or
      'private'. For example:
           
          disco show-files -f %comp/kernel_src/private
                
      This will limit the output to only those files within the specific
      component section.
           
    %nc/<comp-name> or %not-comp/<comp-name>
       
      Similar to %c and %comp, but only show the files that reside outside
      that component. For example:
           
          disco show-files -f %comp/kernel_src
                
      Component section names (private, public) can also be used.
