-l | --long

  Display the task's command string on a single line, without any forced
  wrapping of the text (as is the default behaviour). In reality, the
  display terminal will likely wrap the content, but for the purpose of
  cutting-and-pasting, or when writing to a text file, the command string
  will appear on a single line.
