Release 0.1.0 on November 15, 2011
----------------------------------

This is an early release version of Disco. It has only been tested
on two variants of Linux: OpenSuSE 11.4 on x86 and Redhat Enterprise
Linux 5.2.

There are likely to be a specific set of development tools necessary
to compile Disco, but these have not yet been identified.

------

To build Disco, do the following:

  % cd DiscoMain/priv
  % ant all -Dversion=<major.minor.bugfix>

------

To run all unit tests, do the following

  % cd DiscoMain/priv
  % ant test-all

  Note: The build will break if any of the tests fail.

------

To run all system regression tests, do the following:

  % cd SystemTests/test-src/cli-tests
  % ./run_tests.pl  ../../../DiscoMain/pub/disco-0.1.0.tar.gz

Make sure you substitute 0.1.0 for the version you built earlier.
